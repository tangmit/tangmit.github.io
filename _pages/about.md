I'm currently an Assistant Professor of [Health Policy and Management at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/health-policy-management). 

My research
---
My work sits at the **intersection of empirical operations management and health services research**. I believe that improvements to health care delivery systems and processes are vital for improving the accessibility, quality, efficiency, and equity of our health care system. 

I have been fascinated by new ways of delivering care, particularly the **growing use of digital technologies in care delivery**. While these technologies hold immense promise, they also introduce new challenges and questions for health care organizations and policy makers. Could these new technologies increase health care costs without commensurate benefit? Could they clash with existing workflows and overburden providers? Could they exacerbate disparities? 

**The impacts of these new technologies are often ambiguous and depend in large part on how organizations deploy them and whether operational processes and organizational structures are adapted to enable them.** Research is critical to guide our understanding of (1) how they are used today, (2) what their impacts are, (3) how they should ideally be used moving forward, and (4) how policy can incentivize and enable the right type of use.
